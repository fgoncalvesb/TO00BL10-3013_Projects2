## Application description

This applications is a to-do list. First, you enter to a log-in screen, where you have to enter a valid e-mail and password in order to continue:
- e-mail: admin@admin.com
- password: admin

Then you access the to-do list, which has the following functionalities:
- You can add items to it
- You can remove items
- You can set items as completed
- You can filter and unfilter completed items
- You can save list to localstorage
- You can empty your localstorage (remove the saved list)

## Self evaluation:

I consider that my application is good enough as to have 30 points. Maybe I could have made a better UI , but nonetheless I think it looks good enough.

## Criteria for assignemnt

1. Todo -list
Design and implement a simple TODO application. Below is an example that you can use as a basis for brainstorming.

## Application requirements:

- The items entered in the field are assembled into a list on the page by pressing the button.
- The content of the input fields must be checked for blank as well as incorrect (eg too short) content
- Incorrect content in the input field causes an error message as well as an incorrect field highlighting (eg red border).
- It must be possible to remove elements from the list and mark the task as done
- The application CSS and JavaScript must be specified in an external CSS file
- The information in the list is stored in a browser, eg localstorage

## Additional functions:

- You may also use drop-down menus and check boxes
- You can implement a counter that shows the number of open items in the list
- Try to come up with some meaningful way to hide and show elements in the app.
- If you wish, you can also use the drag & drop functionality of HTML5 in the list
- You can implement buttons (also shown at the bottom of the image) that only display active or completed tasks

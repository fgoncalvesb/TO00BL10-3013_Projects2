## Application description

This applications connects with 2 APIs from Digitraffic as to perfrom two tasks:

 - Get a list of short codenames of finnish train stations
 - Then use those names in order to look for a timetable of a train that goes from station A to station B
 
## Self evaluation:

I consider that my application is good enough as to have 30 points. It looks good enough, it uses things that we have learnt and used in the previous project and it interacts with two different APIs. As to have extra points, I added that input fields accept custom search strings.
